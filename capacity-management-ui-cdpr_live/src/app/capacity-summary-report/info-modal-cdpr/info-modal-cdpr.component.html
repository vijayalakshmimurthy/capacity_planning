        <p>For Edge Rt  capacity summary will be based on user selected product-type of Broadband, Ethernet and Backhaul and gives
             a count of Total number of ports, used ports, reserved ports, Free ports, Inflight Ports and Free slots. </p>
             <p>For Core Rt Capacity summary will be based on user selected Optic-type of SR4, SR10, LR4, DD-SR4 and DD-LR4 and gives a count of Total number of ports, used ports (Access ports and Network Ports),
                  reserve ports, Free Ports, Inflight Ports and Free Slots.</p>
                  <p>Below are the definitions for the column displayed in the report:</p>

        <p><span class="selectedfilter">Used Ports:</span> It will display total number of used ports for a site which has any service on it or connectivity
            or conductor. Basically used ports means the ports which can’t be used to plan for any new service as it is being
            used by means in the network. The port which has connection status as Connected Ok in PACs</p>
        <img class="spaceMargin" src="assets/images/usedports.png">
        <p>For Core Rt Used Ports will be sum of Access ports and Network ports. Access ports are ones which are terminating on /connected to IPP, PlusNet, RCN and RSN sites and all other ports will be network
             ports which will be terminated/connected to MSC, EEA, IEA, MSE, FPE etc.</p>
        <p><span class="selectedfilter">Reserved Ports:</span> It will display total number of reserved ports for a site which has been reserved in PACS
            and LIMS and set with Reservation flag and capacity usage flag( To indicate the purpose of reserving the port
            for Ethernet or Broadband etc.) . </p>
        <p><span class="selectedfilter">Free Ports:</span> It will display total number of free ports for a site for which Connection status in PACs
            is other than “Connected Ok” or Reservation on it.</p>

                    <span class="selectedfilter">&#9900; Further description: </span> We consider spare slots only in eligible chassis, and convert these
                    into equivalent numbers of 10GE ports. (Eligible means MSEs which are either running with 2T chassis speed,
                    or which contain no cards that limit speed below 2T). We assume a BT rule that limits the number of HSQ cards
                    in any chassis to ONE (this is a slight simplification that doesn’t consider REM solution).
                    <br> So if there is already an installed HSQ in a chassis, any spare ports can only be used for Ethernet, so
                    are “Potential Eth Ports” If there is not already an installed HSQ, the first spare slot could be used for
                    either BB or Eth (both not both!), so is counted as “Potential BB/Eth ports”, while any additional free slots
                    can be counted only as “Potential Eth Ports”
